1. Introduction
--------------------------------
Welcome to Musclapp! Musclapp is a user input and muscle building game app that will be available on iOS platform devices. 
The app is directed to teen and adults who desire to improve their muscles but do not have enough time to go to the gym. 
By using Musclapp, they can build muscle anywhere, even at home, without any fitness equipment. The app is recommended from 
mid to late high school level education when physical education has become an optional course, and older. The app is built towards 
building specific muscle through different exercises and user input data, which is used to calculate the score. Three levels 
of difficulty are involved in the app: level 1 (easy), level 2 (medium), level 3 (hard). In each level, the app have 3 different 
exercises that aim the training of specific muscle (arms (upper), core (abdominals, pectorals, etc.), and legs (calves, hamstring, etc.)). 
The app requires the user have the iPhone in close proximity – whether it is strapped, or placed nearby -- depending on the exercise
to track their development. Lastly Musclapp is a personal use app only, that encourages limb strengthening along with decreasing
stroke and/or heart attacks through cardiovascular activities.
